    "intro": "Artist",
    "artist": "Benzi Brofman",
    "paragraph_1": "Benzi (Ben Zion) Brofman is an Israeli Muralist / Street Artist. Benzi was born in 1983 and lives in Migdal HaEmek, in the north of Israel. He took his first steps in the world of art at the age of 4, when he started experimenting with different creative materials. Benzi is a self-taught artist, who never formally studied art and made his way into the graffiti and street art world on his own. He began expressing interest in the world of street art in his teens and later became a full-time Graffiti Artist. Today Benzi designs walls for a wide variety of businesses in Israel (such as Aroma Espresso Bar, Golda Ice Cream, Cafe Cafe, Sarona Market, etc.), High-Tech offices, sports complexes, urban projects to improve the city's appearance, and more. He also leaves his mark in different cities around the world (including Amsterdam, Moscow, Vienna, Barcelona, ​​London and Berlin). Benzi's preferred art style is creating realistic portraits in black and white with touches of color. Alongside his business work, Benzi takes part in voluntary and community projects to promote social issues, such as bullying among children, and support for human rights.",
    "paragraph_2": "On October 6th, 2023, just a few hours before the terrible massacre, Benzi was invited to paint live at the Unity Music Festival in Re’im (after which the Nova festival started). Contrary to his original plans to stay until Saturday, he returned home the same day. Since the October 7th massacre, Benzi decided to put on hold all his projects in favor of supporting the families of the victims and the hostages. He first painted portraits for families who lost their loved ones and held graffiti workshops for families evacuated from the Otef Gaza area to Emek Izrael. Later, he began to paint large-scale murals for the return of the hostages from Gaza.",
    "paragraph_3": "So far Benzi has painted about 100 portraits to commemorate the victims of 7/10 and the fallen soldiers and portraits to raise awareness of the hostages alongside large murals in several cities in Israel and Europe (among them a 20 meter high mural on a building in Berlin), which have received a lot of attention on social media and in the press. The paintings were presented during April 2024 in a unique exhibition that combines an audio-visual show called \"Look into their eyes\", which allowed visitors to look into their eyes up close and get to know the stories behind the paintings.",
    "paragraph_4": "Alongside the project of support and commemoration paintings, Benzi gives lectures in Israel and Europe about the artistic journey that has been going on since October 7 and initiates activities to support the Jewish communities abroad."
